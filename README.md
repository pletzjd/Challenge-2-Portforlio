# Challenge-2-Portforlio

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a portfolio website to showcase our work for potential future employers. The functionality that was desired to be implemented was:

- A navigation bar with links to ‘About Me’, ‘My Work’ and ‘Contact Me’ sections.
- Clickable image links to live deployment of projects to be showcased.
- Altering the image links when hovered over to show
- Having the first image link larger than the others to draw attention to our best work
- The ability to re-size the page and still maintain functionality and continue to be visually appealing

## Live Deployment link

The live deployment of the site can be found at: https://pletzjd.github.io/Challenge-2-Portforlio/

## Usage

The main functionalities of the site are:

- The nav bar at the top right and which links to the corresponding sections on the webpage.
