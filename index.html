            <p>I grew up in North Bay, On where I graduate from St. Joseph Scollard Hall Secondary School. I was
                accepted into and attended McMaster University in Hamilton, On into the their engineering program. After
                the first general year, when picking my specialization I strongly debated between software and chemical
                engineering. While I found I enjoyed software more, my first year was my first exposure to coding and
                decided to go with chemical engineering which I felt I had a better background in at the time. After
                graduating I eventually got a job as a chemical technician for Terrapure Environmental (which later got
                bought out by GFL environmental). After working there for roughly two and half years I decided to pursue
                my other interest of coding and enrolled in the University of Toronto School of Continuing Education's
                Coding Bootcamp.</p>
 
            <p>On the more personal end, my main hobby is video games, particularly those of the rpg genre. While I miss
                the days of couch co-op as most new titles have prefered to shift to online multiplayer, even before the
                pandemic, I still enjoy hopping onto discord to play games with friends from around the world. Outside
                of gaming, I like to stay active by cycling when weather permits, as well as doing basic cardio
                exercises in my apartment when it does not, particularly during the colder months.</p>
